Student database system where user could 
1. get used size in the database
2. add a student
3. delete a student
4. print out records of a student
5. get a list of all student ids
6. check if a student exits

Designed and implemented a student database system using C, structured with header files and separate C source files. 
The system manages student information, such as enrollment, grades, and personal details, and provides functions for adding, deleting and retrieving student records. 

Key features:
1. Implemented using header files for function declarations and multiple C files for function definitions, promoting code organization and reusability.
2. Engaged in learning model design compilers, linkers, and symbol tables, including how linkers resolve function calls across multiple files.
3. Learned how to troubleshoot and resolve common compiler and linker errors, such as undefined references and multiple definition errors.
4. Improved code portability and memory efficiency through the use of standardized data types like uint32.
